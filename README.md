# Virtual_Cell
An implementation of a mathematical model of a virtual biological cell created for the purpose of exploring the dynamics of a constructed "biology"

Current model includes two simple mechanisms: 
- Diffusion of chemical species through cellular membrane (interaction with 'habitat')
- Metabolism modeled by enzyme kinetics

The aim of this project is to explore any possible emergent effects that may arise from the interactions of a cell's basic components.

Future iterations may include the following extensions:
- Mitochondrial structure (implements energy units)
- DNA transcription/translation (applies to enzyme synthesis)
- Membrane channels (active and passive)
- Cellular growth, DNA replication, mitosis
