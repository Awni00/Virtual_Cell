# Virtual_Cell
An implementation of a mathematical model of a virtual biological cell created for the purpose of exploring the dynamics of a constructed "biology"

Current model includes two simple mechanisms: 
- Diffusion of chemical species through cellular membrane
- Metabolism modeled by enzyme kinetics

The aim of this project is to explore any possible emergent effects that may arise from the interactions of a cell's basic components.
